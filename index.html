		<p class = "text">Hi, my name is Lawrence Zhao. I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley. I'm part of the inaugural class of 2021 of the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology program, a joint program between the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business here at Cal. I'm an Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) and Business Administration double major.</p><br></br>
		<p class = "text">I'm a big proponent of eSports. I've been playing League of Legends for many years now, and I have dabbled in other popular titles such as Starcraft, Hearthstone, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and Overwatch. I've chosen to study EECS and Business to pursue this passion. I believe that eSports require both the technical expertise to advance the game industry and fully implement VR, as well as the business/marketing expertise to turn competitive video games into the massive entertainment behemoths that the NFL and NBA are today.</p><br></br>
		<p class = "text">I am proficient at programming in Java, Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I also have experience in Scheme, LISP, and C. Over the past few summers, I worked at University of Maryland, College Park, under Professor Amol Deshpande of the Computer Science department, researching algorithms that would efficiently traverse probabilistic and/or trees, as well as at the National Institutes of Health in the IT Support Division, implementing cloud-based, automated testing programs.</p><br></br>
		<p class = "text">I grew up in Rockville, MD and attended the Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, MD. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball and watching anime and Korean dramas.</p>
